		       Useless Containers Library
		       ==========================


The Useless  Containers Library  (UCL) is  an implementation  of generic
data type containers for the C language.  The containers are:

* list, double-linked list;

* circular, a circular double-linked list;

* vector,  an array  with arrangements  that allow  the minimisation  of
  memory reallocations;

* map, an AVL tree used to implement an associative container;

* tree, a not-binary tree structure;

* heap, sorts elements;

* graph, one day it will be implemented.

GNU+Linux  system.   It is  distributed  under  the GNU  General  Public
License version 3.0.
