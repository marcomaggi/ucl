The  Useless Containers  Library  (UCL) is  an implementation  of
generic data type containers  for the C language.  The containers
are:

* list, double-linked list;

* circular, a circular double-linked list;

* vector, an array with  arrangements that allow the minimisation
  of memory reallocations;

* map, an AVL tree used to implement an associative container;

* tree, a not-binary tree structure;

* heap, sorts elements;

* graph, one day it will be implemented.


  The package makes use of the  GNU Autotools and it is tested on
a  GNU+Linux system.   It is  distributed under  the GNU  General
Public License version 3.0.

  The  latest version  of  this package  can  be downloaded  from
Github:
