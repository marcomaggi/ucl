1. Overview
-----------

The Useless  Containers Library  (UCL) is  an implementation  of generic
data type containers for the C language.  The containers are:

* list, double-linked list;

* circular, a circular double-linked list;

* vector,  an array  with arrangements  that allow  the minimisation  of
  memory reallocations;

* map, an AVL tree used to implement an associative container;

* tree, a not-binary tree structure;

* heap, sorts elements;

* graph, one day it will be implemented.

  The  library  is developed  and  tested  under the  GNU+Linux  system,
requires the  GNU C library  and compiles fine  with the GNU  C compiler
("-std=c99 -pedantic" switches).

3. Install
----------

To install from a proper release tarball, do this:

    $ cd ucl-0.1.0
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../configure
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

to inspect the available configuration options:

    $ ../configure --help

  The Makefile is designed to allow parallel builds, so we can do:

   $ make -j4 all && make -j4 check

which,  on  a  4-core  CPU,   should  speed  up  building  and  checking
significantly.

  The  Makefile supports  the  DESTDIR environment  variable to  install
files in a temporary location, example: to see what will happen:

    $ make -n install DESTDIR=/tmp/ucl

to really do it:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/ucl

  After the installation it is  possible to verify the installed library
against the test suite with:

    $ make installcheck

  From  a repository  checkout or  snapshot  (the ones  from the  Github
site): we  must install the  GNU Autotools (GNU Automake,  GNU Autoconf,
GNU Libtool),  then we must first  run the script "autogen.sh"  from the
top source directory, to generate the needed files:

    $ cd ucl
    $ sh autogen.sh

notice  that  "autogen.sh"  will   run  the  programs  "autoreconf"  and
"libtoolize"; the  latter is  selected through the  environment variable
"LIBTOOLIZE",  whose  value  can  be  customised;  for  example  to  run
"glibtoolize" rather than "libtoolize" we do:

   $ LIBTOOLIZE=glibtoolize sh autogen.sh

  After this the  procedure is the same  as the one for  building from a
proper release tarball, but we have to enable maintainer mode:

    $ ../configure --enable-maintainer-mode [options]
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install


4. Usage

Read the documentation in Texinfo format.


A. Credits
----------

The  stuff was  written by  Marco Maggi.   If this  package exists  it's
because of the great GNU software tools that he uses all the time.

  The   last  portion   of  "src/ucl.c"   is  a   modified  version   of
"stdlib/qsort.c" from the GNU C Library version 2.4; it is Copyright (C)
1991, 1992, 1996, 1997, 1999, 2004 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

A bug  in UCL is my  fault only.  Bug reports  are appreciated, register
