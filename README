1. Overview
-----------

The  Useless Containers  Library  (UCL) is  an implementation  of
generic data type containers  for the C language.  The containers
are:

* list, double-linked list;

* circular, a circular double-linked list;

* vector, an array with  arrangements that allow the minimisation
  of memory reallocations;

* map, an AVL tree used to implement an associative container;

* tree, a not-binary tree structure;

* heap, sorts elements;

* graph, one day it will be implemented.

  The library is developed and tested under the Linux+GNU system,
requires  the GNU  C library  and compiles  fine with  the  GNU C
compiler ("-std=c99 -pedantic" switches).

3. Make and install
-------------------

To install from a proper release tarball, do this:

    $ cd ucl-2.0d0
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../configure
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

to inspect the available configuration options:

    $ ../configure --help

  From a repository checkout or  snapshot (the ones from the
Github site): we  may need to manually  run "libtoolize" the
first time, then  we must first run  the script "autogen.sh"
from the top source directory, to generate the needed files:

    $ sh autogen.sh

for  this  we need  to  have  installed the  GNU  Autotools:
Automake, Autoconf, Libtool.  After this:

    $ ../configure --enable-maintainer-mode [options]
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

  The Makefile supports  the DESTDIR environment variable to
install files in a  temporary location, example: to see what
will happen:

    $ make -n install DESTDIR=/tmp/ucl

to really do it:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/template

  After  the  installation  it  is possible  to  verify  the
installed library against the test suite with:

    $ make installcheck

The stuff  was written  by Marco Maggi.   If this  package exists
it's because of the great GNU software tools that he uses all the
time.

  The  last  portion of  "src/ucl.c"  is  a  modified version  of
"stdlib/qsort.c"  from  the GNU  C  Library  version  2.4; it  is
