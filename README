1. Overview
-----------

The  Useless Containers  Library  (UCL) is  an implementation  of
generic data type containers  for the C language.  The containers
are:

* list, double-linked list;

* circular, a circular double-linked list;

* vector, an array with  arrangements that allow the minimisation
  of memory reallocations;

* map, an AVL tree used to implement an associative container;

* tree, a not-binary tree structure;

* heap, sorts elements;

* graph, one day it will be implemented.

  The library is developed and tested under the Linux+GNU system,
requires  the GNU  C library  and compiles  fine with  the  GNU C
compiler ("-std=c99 -pedantic" switches).

2. Usage
--------

Read the documentation in Texinfo format.

  The library  can be built  for both static linking  and dynamic
linking.  There are containers  that depends on other containers.
It is enough to include the main header file "ucl.h".

  All the function names and data types are prefixed with "ucl_".


3. Make and install
-------------------

Do this:

    $ cd ucl-xxx
    $ mkdir "=build"
    $ ../configure [options]
    $ make
    $ make install

to test the library:

    $ make tests

to run tests for a single container:

    $ make test-btree
    $ make test-circular
    $ make test-graph
    $ make test-hash
    $ make test-heap
    $ make test-list
    $ make test-map
    $ make test-tree
    $ make test-vector

each test has a name, to run  a single test we can use the "name"
environment variable:

    $ make test-vector name=vector-1.2

  Warning: the code makes (sometimes heavy) use of the "assert()"
macro;  to  exclude them  use  the  "--disable-assert" option  of
"configure".

The stuff  was written  by Marco Maggi.   If this  package exists
it's because of the great GNU software tools that he uses all the
time.

  The  last  portion of  "src/ucl.c"  is  a  modified version  of
"stdlib/qsort.c"  from  the GNU  C  Library  version  2.4; it  is
