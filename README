1. Overview
-----------

The Useless Containers Library (UCL) is an implementation of
generic  data  type  containers  for the  C  language.   The
containers are:

* list, double linked list;

* circular, a circular double linked list;

* vector,  an   array  with  arrangements   that  allow  the
  minimisation of memory reallocations;

* map,  an  AVL  tree   used  to  implement  an  associative
  container;

* tree, a not binary tree structure;

* heap, a map used as priority queue;

* graph, one day it will be implemented.

  The library  is developed  and tested under  the Linux+GNU
system, requires  the GNU C  library and compiles  fine with
the GNU C compiler ("-std=c99 -pedantic" switches).

2. Usage
--------

Read the documentation in Texinfo format.

  The  library can  be  built for  both  static linking  and
dynamic linking.  There are containers that depends on other
containers.  It  is enough to  include the main  header file
"ucl.h".

  All the  function names and  data types are  prefixed with
"ucl_".


3. Make and install
-------------------

Do this:

    $ cd ucl-xxx
    $ mkdir "=build"
    $ ../configure [options]
    $ make
    $ make install
    
to test the shared, the static and the stub library:

    $ make test
    $ make test-static
    $ make test-stub

  Warning:  the  code makes  (sometimes  heavy)  use of  the
"assert()" macro; to exclude them use the "--disable-assert"
option of "configure".


A. Credits
----------

The  stuff was  written  by Marco  Maggi.   If this  package
exists it's because of the  great GNU software tools that he
uses all the time.

  The last  portion of "src/ucl.c" is a  modified version of
"stdlib/qsort.c" from  the GNU C Library version  2.4; it is

B. Bug reports
--------------

A bug in UCL is  my fault only. Bug reports are appreciated,
register them at the GNA!  site.
