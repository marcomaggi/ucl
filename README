1. Overview
-----------

This is  the README file  for the Useless  Container Library
(UCL). It provides basic informations about the usage of the
package.   UCL is  an  implementation of  generic data  type
containers for the C language.  The containers are:

* list, double linked list;

* circular, a circular double linked list;

* vector,  an   array  with  arrangements   that  allow  the
  minimisation of memory reallocations;

* map,  an  AVL  tree   used  to  implement  an  associative
  container;

* tree, a tree structure;

others...

2. Usage
--------

The library can be built for both static linking and dynamic
linking. There are no  problems in including just the object
files that we require:

* the  main header  file  "ucl.h" should  be  always in  the
  include path;

* for   each   container  there's   a   source  file   named
  "ucl_<cnt>.c".

  There are containers that depends on other containers. 


3. Make and install
-------------------

The classic:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make test
    $ make install

should work. This package  requires the GNU tools: GNU make,
GNU C Compiler. 

  The  following commands  may be  used to  build compressed
archives for distributions in source and binary forms:

    $ make dist
    $ make bindist

GNU tar and gzip are required. On a Debian GNU system:

    $ make debian

should build .deb packages.

  Warning: the  code makes use  of the "assert()"  macro. To
reduce  the  code  size  exclude it  defining  the  "NDEBUG"
symbol:

    $ make all CFLAGS="-O2 -DNDEBUG"


A. Credits
----------

The  stuff was  written  by Marco  Maggi.   If this  package
exists it's because of the  great GNU software tools that he
uses all the time.


B. Bug reports
--------------

A bug in UCL is  my fault only. Bug reports are appreciated,
send them to me by email.  To get my email address, take the
mail hostname of my  ISP, which is "tiscalinet.it", and join
it with my mail username, which is "marcomaggi".
