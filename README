1. Overview
-----------

The Useless Containers Library (UCL) is an implementation of
generic  data  type  containers  for the  C  language.   The
containers are:

* list, double linked list;

* circular, a circular double linked list;

* vector,  an   array  with  arrangements   that  allow  the
  minimisation of memory reallocations;

* map,  an  AVL  tree   used  to  implement  an  associative
  container;

* tree, a not binary tree structure;

* heap, a map used as priority queue;

* graph, one day it will be implemented.

  The library  is developed  and tested under  the Linux+GNU
system, requires  the GNU C  library and compiles  fine with
the GNU C compiler ("-std=c99 -pedantic" switches).

2. Usage
--------

The library can be built for both static linking and dynamic
linking.   There  are   containers  that  depends  on  other
containers. It is enough to include the main header files.

  All the  function names and  data types are  prefixed with
"ucl_".

  Warning:  the  code makes  (sometimes  heavy)  use of  the
"assert()"  macro.   To  reduce  the code  size  exclude  it
defining the "NDEBUG" symbol; example:

    $ make all CFLAGS="-O2 -DNDEBUG"

  To test the shared, the static and the stub library:

    $ make test
    $ make test-static
    $ make test-stub


3. Make and install
-------------------

Read the INSTALL file. The classic:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

should work. This package  requires the GNU tools: GNU make,
GNU C Compiler. 


A. Credits
----------

The  stuff was  written  by Marco  Maggi.   If this  package
exists it's because of the  great GNU software tools that he
uses all the time.

  The file last portion  of "src/ucl." is a modified version
of "stdlib/qsort.c"  from the GNU C Library  version 2.4; it
is Copyright (C) 1991,1992,1996,1997,1999,2004 Free Software
Foundation, Inc.


B. Bug reports
--------------

A bug in UCL is  my fault only. Bug reports are appreciated,
register them at the GNA!  site.
