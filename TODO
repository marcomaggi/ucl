		 Useless Containers Library
		 ==========================

		    List of things to do
		    --------------------


0.9
---

* Understand why in hell when upgrading the Slackware packge
  'doinst.sh' is executed twice.

## ------------------------------------------------------------

Candidates
----------

* Look for soft heaps. 
* Look for Splay trees.


Vector
------

* Erase by range of slot pointers.


Graph
-----

* Tests.
* Path-between-nodes existence predicate after DFS. 
* Add algorithms

   - connected  graph predicate  (DFS-not-honor  on a  node,
     then check if all the nodes have been touched);

   - acyclic graph predicate;

   - linearisation  of  nodes  for  DAGs  (directed  acyclic
     graphs):  build a string  of nodes  in which  the order
     left-to-right  honors  the  link  horders  (based  upon
     DFS-honor);

   ... see the book on graph algorithms

* Document algorithms.


Tree
----

* Write the levelorder iterator for the tree container? Also
  known as breadth first.

* Write  the "string"  iterator  for the  tree. An  iterator
  whose value  is the string of  nodes from the  root to the
  currently selected one.


Binary tree
-----------

* Write the "string" iterator for the binary tree?


Hash table
----------

* Complete the module with reallocation policy functions and
  configuration of resizing.


Heap
----

* Tests for merge.
