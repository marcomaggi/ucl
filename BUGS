		     Known bugs in UCL
		     =================


* Testing of the erase function  in the map and multimap has
  been difficult, I'm not so sure of the result.

* Testing of  the reallocation  functions for the  vector is
  probably incomplete.

* The  various forms of  map and  multimap iteration  seem a
  correct  implementation  of   what  I  think  they  should
  be. But, are they really supposed to behave in this way?
