@section Memory allocation for pathname instances


@value{PACKAGE} allocates data structures using memory allocators as defined by the package
CCMemory, @ccmemoryref{allocators, The generic allocators @api{}}.

From the point of view of instance constructors, there are two categories:

@table @dfn
@item embedded
An @dfn{embedded} instance of a @struct{} type is allocated on the stack or embedded into an
enclosing data structure.  The constructors of such instances do not have to allocate memory for the
instance itself; they might allocate memory for the internal representation of the instance.

When the facilities of @file{ccnames.h} are used: the constructors for embedded instances have names
generated by @cfunc{ccname_init}; @ccstructsref{ccnames struct common, Well known functions for
@struct{} types}.

@item standalone
A @dfn{standalone} instance of a @struct{} type is allocated on the heap.  The constructors of such
instances do have to allocate memory for both the instance itself and the internal representation of
the pathname.

When the facilities of @file{ccnames.h} are used: the constructors for embedded instances have names
generated by @cfunc{ccname_new}; @ccstructsref{ccnames struct common, Well known functions for
@struct{} types}.
